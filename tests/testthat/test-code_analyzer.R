  # 3. Asserting that the returned list of elements is correct (name, signature, code_block, etc.).

  # Example (conceptual):
  # code <- "my_func <- function(a, b) { a + b }"
  # elements <- extract_r_code_elements("test.R", code) # Assuming function is accessible
  # expect_equal(length(elements$functions), 1)

  # 3. Asserting that the returned nodes and edges of the call graph are correct.

  # Example (conceptual):
  # # Setup temp files file1.R: "f1 <- function() { f2() }", file2.R: "f2 <- function() { }"
  # # graph_data <- generate_r_call_graph(c("file1.R", "file2.R"), temp_dir_path)
