  # Placeholder for testing Mermaid graph syntax generation.

  # 1. Creating sample call_graph_data (nodes and edges).
  # 2. Calling generate_mermaid_call_graph().
  # 3. Asserting that the output string is valid Mermaid syntax and reflects the graph.
  #
  # Example (conceptual):
  # graph_data <- list(nodes = c("n_A", "n_B"), edges = list(list(caller="n_A", callee="n_B")))
  # mermaid_code <- generate_mermaid_call_graph(graph_data)
  # expect_true(grepl("graph TD;", mermaid_code))

  # Placeholder for testing Quarto document rendering.
  # Real tests are complex as they involve file I/O and Quarto execution.
  # Might involve:
  # 1. Calling render_quarto_document with minimal inputs.
  # 2. Checking if a .qmd file is created.
  # 3. Potentially (if Quarto runs) checking if an output HTML/PDF is created.
  # 4. This would require a minimal Quarto installation in the test environment.
