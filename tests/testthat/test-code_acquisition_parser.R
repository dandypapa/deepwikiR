# Placeholder for tests for acquire_code_content()
# Actual tests would require mocking file system operations or git cloning,
# which is complex for this automated environment.

  # For now, this is a conceptual placeholder.
  # A real test would involve:
  # 1. Creating a temporary directory with sample files.
  # 2. Calling acquire_code_content with a config pointing to this temp dir.
  # 3. Asserting that the returned list of code_details is correct.
  #    - Correct file names (relative paths)
  #    - Correct file content
  # 4. Cleaning up the temporary directory.
  #
  # Example structure (conceptual, not to be run by worker if setup fails):
  # temp_dir <- tempfile("test_acquire_")
  # dir.create(temp_dir)
  # writeLines("test content", file.path(temp_dir, "testfile.R"))
  # config <- list(local_path = temp_dir)
  # sourced_content <- acquire_code_content(config) # Assuming function is accessible
  # expect_equal(length(sourced_content), 1)
  # expect_true("testfile.R" %in% names(sourced_content))
  # expect_equal(sourced_content[["testfile.R"]], "test content")
  # unlink(temp_dir, recursive = TRUE)

  expect_true(TRUE, info = "Placeholder test for code_acquisition_parser.R. Real tests need file system mocking or setup.")
})

# Add more tests here if specific pure functions from the parser can be isolated.
