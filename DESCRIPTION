Description: An advanced tool for automated documentation generation and exploration of R code repositories. 
    It combines static code analysis, Large Language Model (LLM) powered insights, and the Quarto publishing 
    framework. Key features include: generation of comprehensive documentation for functions and code 
    elements, visualization of function/module call graphs using Mermaid diagrams, support for multiple 
    projects via a unified configuration, generation of directory-level summaries, an interactive chat 
    mode for Q&A about the codebase, and export of documented elements for LLM fine-tuning. 
    The system supports code from local file systems and Git repositories, and aims to adhere to 
    R package structure using Roxygen2 for inline documentation.
